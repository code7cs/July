### 1. What is non-breaking in &nbsp;
- Alternatively referred to as a fixed space or hard space, NBSP (non-breaking space) is used in programming, 
 and word processing to create a space in a line that cannot be broken by word wrap.
 With HTML, &nbsp; allows you to create multiple spaces that are visible on a web page and not only in the source code.

### 2. What is encoding.
- In computers, encoding is the process of putting a sequence of characters (letters, numbers, punctuation, 
and certain symbols) into a specialized format for efficient transmission or storage.
- Computer storage can only work with bytes. Encoding is the process of converting text to bytes.
 Over the past few decades, different encoding schemes have been developed for different purposes, such as brevity, compatibility, or internationalization.

### 3. .txt , .doc, .html
- HTML  stands for HyperText Markup Language. Itâ€™s the way web pages and email templates are coded so that text is formatted and images are added.
- A DOC file is a word processing document created by Microsoft Word, or another word processing programs. 
    It may contain formatted text, images, tables, graphs, charts, page formatting, and print settings.
- Plain Text is regular text, with no formatting options such as bold, italics, underlines, or special layout options.

### 4. id Vs name
- The ID of a form input element has nothing to do with the data contained within the element. 
IDs are for hooking the element with JavaScript and CSS. 
- The name attribute, however, is used in the HTTP request sent by your browser to the server as a variable name associated with the data contained in the value attribute.
- Name does not have to be unique, and can be used to group elements together such as radio buttons & checkboxes

### 5. Apply color to a textarea by using color input tag
